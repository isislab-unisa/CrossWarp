<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üìñ About The Project

![CrossWarp][product-screenshot]



CrossWarp is a framework that unifies mobile AR devices (Android and iOS) and desktops into a single collaborative ecosystem. It not only ensures seamless transitions between the physical and virtual worlds but also provides a device-independent architecture designed to maximize interoperability. The system enables co-present users, such as two people using AR-enabled smartphones, to manipulate shared objects in real time while preserving their state and context, regardless of the platform used.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### üìå Prerequisites

Unity 2022.3 or later must be installed, to install it you can use Unity Hub.

### üîß Installation

1. Install Photon Fusion following the instructions on the Photon website (https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/getting-started/sdk-download).
    - Add your AppID in the Photon Fusion configuration
2. Install CrossWarp via the Unity Package Manager by following these steps:
    - Open the Package Manager.
    - Click on "Add package from git URL".
    - Enter the following URL: https://github.com/isislab-unisa/CrossWarp.git?path=/Assets/CrossWarp

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
After importing, some parameters need to be configured in Project Settings:
  - In XR Plugin Management, enable ARCore or ARKit, depending on the target platform.
  - In XR Plugin Management, run Project Validation to detect and fix any configuration issues.
  - In Player ‚Üí Other Settings, disable the Vulkan Graphics API.
  - In Player ‚Üí Other Settings, change the Scripting Backend to IL2CPP and enable ARM64 support.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## üéÆ Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can use the components provided by CrossWarp to develop Cross-Reality experiences. The package includes example scenes demonstrating the core components, including the integration of interactive objects with physics mechanics. These examples can be imported and used as a foundation for building new collaborative and immersive applications.

By examining the HouseScene included in the package, you can see how to configure the environment for Cross-Reality experiences. The key components are:
- AR Scene Objects: XR Interaction Manager, AR Session, XR Origin
- Photon Configuration Objects: Prototype Network Start, Prototype Runner

![Product Name Screen Shot][housescene]

The House object contains all the static elements of the house structure that do not interact with CrossWarp. In contrast, objects like SofaDouble, SofaArmChair, TableRectangleShort, and LampTall are designed to be transported between different realities.

### How To Configure Objects
To enable an object to be transported between different realities, you need to configure specific components within it:
- AR Anchor
- Outline
- Collider (customized based on the object)
- Network Object
  - with AllowStateAuthority set to true
- Movable Object
- Transition Manager

With these components configured, any type of object can seamlessly transition between the two worlds.
