    "description": "CrossWarp is a framework that unifies mobile AR devices (Android and iOS) and desktops into a single collaborative ecosystem. It not only ensures seamless transitions between the physical and virtual worlds but also provides a device-independent architecture designed to maximize interoperability. The system enables co-present users, such as two people using AR-enabled smartphones, to manipulate shared objects in real time while preserving their state and context, regardless of the platform used.",
